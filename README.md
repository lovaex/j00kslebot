# j00kslebot
An example of bot using nodejs' slack-client. 

The necessary file lib/token.json is obviously not committed to the GitHub repo :-)

You need:
  - nodejs
  - npm
  - requestify
  - slack-client
  - mocha
  - chai
  - chai-spies

Sorry for this repo's quality, I'm new to NodeJS (and JS and git too) and don't know the "best practices".
